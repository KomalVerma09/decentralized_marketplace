# 🛒 Decentralized-Marketplace  

Welcome to the **Decentralized E-Commerce Platform**! This project demonstrates a blockchain-powered marketplace for secure and transparent buying and selling of products using **tBNB** and the custom **eBLK Token**.  

---

## 🚀 About the Project  

This application allows sellers to list products and buyers to purchase them using native cryptocurrency (tBNB) or the **eBLK Token**. Payments are securely held in escrow until the buyer confirms delivery, ensuring trust for both parties. A 2% commission is automatically transferred to the platform owner upon delivery confirmation.

## 📋 How to Test  

1. **Product Listing:**  
   - Sellers can list items by entering the product title, description, and price.  

2. **Buying a Product:**  
   - Buyers can choose a product, select a payment method (BNB or eBLK), and complete the purchase.  

3. **Confirm Delivery:**  
   - Buyers confirm delivery to release the funds to the seller and pay the commission to the platform owner.
